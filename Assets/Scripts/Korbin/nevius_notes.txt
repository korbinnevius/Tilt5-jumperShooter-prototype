Notes for the player prefab
---
Use the player controller for input on the character while the RBcharactercontroller controls physics behind the character.
The player prefab itself needs to include the player, playerinteractionhandeler, charactercontrollerinput, rbcharactercontroller,
script.
    In the playerinteracionhandler you need to have separate colliders with an interactor and grabbable script. 
    If player level script is on the player then you need to have the level markers on the stage.
    You don't need to fill up the character material options in the player script. 
    For future, mess with the rotation function inside the rbcharactercontroller.
    For future animation controls, reference the charactercontrollerinput script for the button events. 
    
Additional scripts that are required for the player that were added later on through prototypign is the shooting, player level, and 
getting shot script. 
Collider on the parent object of the character while the alternate materials don't need any collider. 
Rigidbody on the parent.
    Meaning all the scripts are on the parent as well.
In order to have the player move, you need to make sure the ground layer on rbcharactercontroller is set to the desired layer of your ground.
Make tags/layers for the player "player"
