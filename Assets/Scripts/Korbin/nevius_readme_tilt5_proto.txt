Hunters Code Use:
---
CharacterControllerInput
Used this code for player movement. Edited the script to trigger things such as jumping. 
Editing settings to help prevent player from clipping through the 
ground. Tried to get the script to trigger animation on walk and jump but the animations
themselves weren't working. 
---
RBCharacterController
Edited the script to somewhat change the rotation for the player for this experience.
Edited the speed and other character related movement decisions. 
---
Player
Sets player index, watches player location to change gameboard location for specific players. 
Allows me to cycle through different materials for each character based on index.  
---
PlayerConnectionHandler
Used this to connect up to three players, can do four but the frame rate drops drastically for four.
---
InteractionHandler
Was there to fill a null reference error. Doesn't affect anything in the game. 
---

---
GameBoardFollow
Logic behind gameboard movement. Gets the level of the player in relation to the level markers in the scene
and lerps the gameboard to the set target location.
